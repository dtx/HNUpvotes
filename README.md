#HNUpvotes
HackerNews for the no nonsense people.

##Purpose
There is a lot of non-sense on news.ycombinator.com nowadays. This simple evening-hack node
application just gets all the best articles, sorts them according to time, and
displays it to the user, thus providing the `latest && best` articles currently
on HN.

Some might say that this limits the article one reads to the choices made by
others. I say you basically doing yourself a favor by not wasting your time.

#Usage
I plan to put it on Heroku, but you can just build it on your machine and access
via __http://localhost:3000__. [Looks like this] (http://cl.ly/image/1K0v471e2R0t)
