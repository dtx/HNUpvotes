#HNUpvotes
HackerNews for the no nonsense people.

##Purpose
There is a lot of non-sense on news.ycombinator.com nowadays. This node
application just gets all the best articles, sorts them according to time, and
displays it to the user, thus providing the (latest && best) articles currently
on HN.

Some might say that this limits the article one reads to the choices made by
others. I say you basically doing yourself a favor by not wasting your time.
